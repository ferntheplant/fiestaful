   - **Framework Preset**: Astro (should auto-detect)
   - **Root Directory**: `./` (leave as default)
4. Click "Deploy"

### Option B: Manual Deploy

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your forked repository
5. Configure settings and deploy

## Step 2: Set Up Supabase

### Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)

2. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/schema.sql`
3. Click "Run" to create the tables
4. Go to **Table Editor** â†’ **event** table
5. Update the default passwords:

   ```sql
   UPDATE event SET 
     admin_password_hash = 'your_admin_password',
     guest_password_hash = 'your_guest_password'
   WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM event LIMIT 1);
   ```

### Get API Keys

1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **API**
2. Copy the **Project URL** and **anon public** key
3. Keep these safe - you'll need them for Vercel

## Step 3: Configure Vercel Environment Variables

```

3. Click "Save"
4. Go to **Deployments** and redeploy your project

## Step 4: Test Your Deployment

1. Visit your deployed URL (e.g., `https://my-event-rsvp.vercel.app`)
2. You should be redirected to the login page
3. Test with your guest password
4. Test admin access at `/admin` with your admin password

## Step 5: Customize Your Event
